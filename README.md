# Analyze-convert-Python
Analyze the data with with using api and convert from csv and url=> to python using python.
Second part using numpy.
In the following part use the file from source:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos/master/data/drinks.csv

1.write a program to get the drinks by country CSV and print it to the console
2.write a program that saves the drinks CSV to a local file named drinks.csv
3.Write a program that converts the drinks csv into json and print the Json of Argentina
4.Write a program calculates the average total litres of pure alcohol.

In the following part use the specific mentioned file:
5.Write a program reads the to-do list from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos and calculates the rate of un completed tasks.
6.Write a program that counts the occurrences of words in 'Alice in Wonderland' and prints each word and its occurrences count.

pip install numpyNumpy:
7.Create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 0 to 8
8.Create a vector of size 10 with values ranging from 0 to 1
9.Create a one dimensional numpy array with 20 elements between 5 and 20. 
reshape that array into a 4 by 5 matrix. Transpose that array and print the element in the second row and third column
10.Create a random vector of size 30 and find the mean value
11.Create two numpy arrays from the following lists [1,3,4,5,2,9] and [22,12,4,32,56,7] Print the multiplication and the subtraction of those two array
12.Reshape the previous two arrays into 2 X 3 matrices and vertically stack them (hint: use the vstack function) print the second to last elements in the second column of the new stacked array
13.Use the stacked array from the previous question. 
Use the sum function to calculate the sum of the elements in each row (note: use the column axis to aggregate rows, e.g. axis=1)
